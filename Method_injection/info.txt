METHOD INJECTION IN SPRING

- Method Injection is a technique where dependencies are injected into,
Individual methods(rather than through constructors or setters)
- This approach allows for dependencies to be provided only when they are needed
in the execution of specific methods
- The injected dependency is ususally not stored as a class member but is used
for that particular method's execution
