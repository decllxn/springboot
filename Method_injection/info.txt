METHOD INJECTION IN SPRING

- Method Injection is a technique where dependencies are injected into,
Individual methods(rather than through constructors or setters)
- This approach allows for dependencies to be provided only when they are needed
in the execution of specific methods
- The injected dependency is usually not stored as a class member but is used
for that particular method's execution

TYPES OF METHOD INJECTION

- Lookup Method Injection
- Arbitrary Method Injection

1. LOOKUP METHOD INJECTION
- Special type of method injection
- Used when the class needs to call a method that 
,returns a new instance of a prototype-scoped bean
- Spring provides @Lookup annotation to define such methods

2. ARBITRARY METHOD Injection
- Dependencies are passed as arguments to any method
- Not just a constructor or a setters
- This type of injection is used when you don't need to store the,
dependency as a field but use it directly in the method
- Unlike lookup method injection, arbitrary method injection doesn't rely,
on @Lookup but instead injects the dependency through method arguments
