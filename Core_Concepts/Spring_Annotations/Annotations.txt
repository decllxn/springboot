SPRING ANNOTATIONS
- This is a core part of the spring Framework

reducing the need for XML configuration
- It is used to configure beans and their dependencies

@Components:
  - Indicates that an annotated class is a "component"
  - It is a special type of bean
  - Marks a Java Class as a Spring-managed component
  - Spring will automatically detect it during component scanning


@Service:
  - Indicates that an annotated class is a "Service
  - Serves as a Specialization of @Component,
    allowing for implementation classes to be autodetected through classpath scanning
  - Also denotes that the class contains business logic

@AutoWired

  - Spring automatically resolves and injects the required beans into,
  the annotated fiels, constructor or setter method
  - It is used to inject dependencies into a class
